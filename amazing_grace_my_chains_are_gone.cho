A[E]mazing grace, how [A]sweet the [E]sound
That [C#m]saved a [A]wretch like [B]me
I [E]once was lost, but [A]now I'm [E]found
Was [C#m]blind, but [A]now [B]I [E]see

{soc}
My [E]chains are [A]gone
I've been set [E]free
My God, my [A]Savior has ransomed [E]me
And like a [A]flood His mercy [C#m]reigns
Unending [B]love, amazing [E]grace
{eoc}

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

{soc}
My [E]chains are [A]gone
I've been set [E]free
My God, my [A]Savior has ransomed [E]me
And like a [A]flood His mercy [C#m]reigns
Unending [B]love, amazing [E]grace
{eoc}

The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow
The sun forbear to shine
But God, Who called me here below,
Will be forever mine.
Will be forever mine.
You are forever mine.

My [E]chains are [A]gone
I've been set [E]free
My God, my [A]Savior has ransomed [E]me
And like a [A]flood His mercy [C#m]reigns
Unending [B]love, amazing [E]grace
{eoc}
