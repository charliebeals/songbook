[C]Before the throne of [F]God [C]above
I have a [C]strong, and perfect [Em]plea:
A great High [F]Priest, [C]whose [G]name is [Am]Love,
Who ever [F]lives and pleads for [C]me.
My name is graven [F]on his [C]hands,
My name is [F]written on his [Am]heart;
I know that [F]while in [G]heaven he [Am]stands
No tongue can [F]bid me thence de[Am]part
No tongue can [F]bid me thence de[C]part.

When Satan tempts me to despair,
And tells me of the guilt within,
Upward I look, and see him there
Who made an end of all my sin.
Because a sinless Savior died,
My sinful soul is counted free;
For God, the Just, is satisfied 
To look on Him and pardon me 
To look on Him and pardon me

Halle[G]lujah! Halle[Em]lujah! [Am]
Praise the [F]One,
Risen [G]Son of [C]God!

Behold him there, the risen Lamb 
My perfect, spotless righteousness, 
The great unchangeable I am,
The King of glory and of grace!
One in himself, I cannot die
My soul is purchased by his blood 
My life is hid with Christ on high, 
With Christ, my Savior and my God 
With Christ, my Savior and my God

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Praise the One,
Risen Son of God!
