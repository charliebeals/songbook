[E]Come, thou long ex[A/E]pected [B/E]Jesus,
[E]Born to set Thy [A/E]peop[B/E]le f[E]ree;
[E]From our fears and [A/E]sins re[B/E]lease us;
[E]Let us find our [A]rest [B]in [E]Thee.
[C#]Israel's [E/G#]strength and [A]consol[B]ation,
[E]Hope of [C#]all the [A]earth Thou [B]art;
[E]Dear Desire of every [B]nat[B/A]ion,
[E/G#]Joy of [A]every [Bsus]longi[B]ng h[E]eart.

Born Thy people to deliver,
Born a child and yet a king.
Born to reign in us forever,
Now Thy gracious kingdom bring.
By Thine own eternal Spirit
Rule in all our hearts alone;
By Thine all sufficient merit,
Raise us to Thy glorious throne.
