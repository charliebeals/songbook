[G]We bow our hearts, [D]we bend our knees
[C]Oh Spirit come and make us humble[G]
[G]We turn our eyes [D]from evil things                   
[C]Oh Lord we cast down our idols

{soc}
Give us clean [G]hands
Give us [D]pure hearts
Let us [Em7]not lift our souls to an[C]other
Give us clean [G]hands
Give us [D]pure hearts
Let us [Em7]not lift our souls to an[C]other
{eoc}

And O God, let us [G]be
A generation that [D]seeks
That seeks Your [Em7]face
O [D]God of [G]Jacob
