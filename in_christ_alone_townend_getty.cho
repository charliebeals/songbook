In [G]Christ a[D]lone my [G]hope is [A]found,
[D/F#]He is my [G]light, [D/F#]my   [Em7]strength,[G/A] my s[D]ong;
This [G]Corner[D]stone, this [G]solid [A]ground,
[D/F#]Firm through the [G]fierc[D/F#]est  [Em7]drou[G/A]ght and [D]storm.
What [D/F#]heights of [G]love, what [D/F#]depths of [Asus]peace,[A]
When [D/F#]fears are [G]stilled, when [Bm7]strivings [Asus]cease![A]
My [G]Comfort[D]er, my [G]All in [A]All,
[D/F#]Here in the [G]love [D/F#]of   [Em7]Christ [G/A]I   [D]stand.

In [G]Christ a[D]lone! — who [G]took on [A]flesh,
[D]Fulness of [G]God in [A]helpless [D]babe!
Thi[G]s gift of [D]love and [G]righteous[A]ness,
[D]Scorned by the [G]ones He [A]came to [D]save: 
Till on the [G]cross as [D]Jesus [A]died,
The [D]wrath of [G]God was [D]satis[A]fied — 
For [G]every [D]sin on [G]Him was [A]laid; 
[D]Here in the [G]death of [A]Christ I [D]live.

There [G]in the [D]ground His body [A]lay,
[D]Light of the [G]world by [A]darkness [D]slain: 
Then [G]bursting [D]forth in [G]glorious [A]Day 
[D]Up from the [G]grave He [A]rose a[D]gain! 
And as He [G]stands in [D]victo[A]ry
Sin’s [D]curse has [G]lost its [D]grip on [A]me,
For [G]I am [D]His and [G]He is [A]mine —
[D]Bought with the [G]precious [A]blood of [D]Christ.

No [G]guilt in [D]life, no [G]fear in [A]death, 
[D]This is the [G]power of [A]Christ in [D]me; 
From [G]life’s first [D]cry to [G]final [A]breath, 
[D]Jesus com[G]mands my [A]desti[D]ny.
No [D]power of [G]hell, no [D]scheme of [A]man, 
Can [D]ever [G]pluck me [D]from His [A]hand; 
Till[G] He re[D]turns or [G]calls me [A]home, 
[D]Here in the [G]power of [A]Christ I’ll [D]stand!
