While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy

Hear the [C]joyful sound of our offering
As Your [Em7/B]saints bow down, as Your people sing
We will [Am7]rise with You lifted on Your wings
And the [Fsus]world will see that
Our God [C]saves, our God s[G]aves
There is [Am]hope in Your n[F]ame

You rule the world, with truth and grace
And make the nations prove
The glories of Your righteousness
The wonders of Your love
The wonders of Your love
The wonders, wonders of Your love
