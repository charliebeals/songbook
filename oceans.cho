[Bm][A][D][A][G]

[Bm]You call me out [A]upon the[D] waters
The great [A]unknown where feet[G] may fail
[Bm]And there I find you in [A]the m[D]ystery
In oceans[A] deep
[G]My faith will stand

{start_of_chorus}
[G]And I will c[D]all upon your[A] name
[G]And keep my e[D]yes above the[A] waves
When oceans r[G]ise
My soul will [D]rest in your [A]embrace
For I am yo[G]urs and yo[A]u are [Bm]min[A]e[D][A][G]
{end_of_chorus}

Your grace abounds in deepest waters
Your sovereign hand
Will be my guide
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
You've never failed and you won't start now

{start_of_chorus}
[G]And I will c[D]all upon your[A] name
[G]And keep my e[D]yes above the[A] waves
When oceans r[G]ise
My soul will [D]rest in your [A]embrace
For I am yo[G]urs and yo[A]u are [Bm]min[A]e[D][A][G]
{end_of_chorus}

In the presence[Em] of my Savior
