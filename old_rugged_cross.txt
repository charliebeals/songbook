[E]So [Esus4]I'll  [E]cherish the old [Esus4]rug - [E]ged [A]cross,
[(A)]Till my [D]trophies at last [E]I [D]lay [A]down;
[(A)]I will cling to the old [Asus4]rug - [A]ged [D]cross,
[(D)]And ex-[A]change it some [E]day for a [A]crown.

On that old  rugged cross, so        de-spised by the world,
Has a wondrous  at-traction for  me;
For  the   dear Lamb of  God   left His  glo -ry      a-bove,
To    bear  it  to  dark Cal-va - ry.

In that old  rugged cross, stained with blood  so  di-vine,
A     wondrous     beauty   I    see;
For 'twas  on   that old cross Jesus     suf -fered and died,
To    pardon  and   sanc-ti -fy   me.

Its   shame and re-proach gladly bear;
To the  old  rugged cross  I    will    e  -   ver be true,
Then He'll call me some  day   to   my   home far     a-way,
Where His glory for e  - ver I'll share.
