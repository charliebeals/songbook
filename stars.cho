[F#m] [E] [A]
[F#m]You spoke a word, life[A] began
[F#m]Told oceans where to start[A] and where to end
[F#m]You set in motion time a[A]nd space
But still you co[F#m]me and you're calling me by na[A]me
Still you c[F#m]ome and you're calling me by n[A]ame

{soc}
If you can hold the st[D]ars in pl[A]ace
You can hold my[E] heart the same
Whenever I f[D]all aw[A]ay
Whenever I s[E]tart to break
So h[D]ere I am, lif[F#m]ting up my he[E]art
To the one who holds the s[F#m]tars [E][A]
{eoc}

[F#m]The deepest steps, the darkest ni[A]ghts
[F#m]Can't separate, can't keep me fr[A]om your side
[F#m]I get so lost, forget [A]my way
But still you l[F#m]ove and you don't forget my n[A]ame

{soc}
If you can hold the st[D]ars in pl[A]ace
You can hold my[E] heart the same
Whenever I f[D]all aw[A]ay
Whenever I s[E]tart to break
So h[D]ere I am, lif[F#m]ting up my he[E]art
If you can calm the ra[D]ging s[A]ea
You can calm the st[E]orm in me
You're never too f[D]ar aw[A]ay
You never show u[E]p too late
So h[D]ere I am, li[F#m]fting up my he[E]art
To the one who holds the s[F#m]tars [E][A]
{eoc}

[F#m][E][A]
Your l[F#m]ove has called m[E]y na[A]me
What do I have to fe[F#m]ar?
What do I have to f[A]ear?
Your lo[F#m]ve has called [E]my n[A]ame
What do I have to fe[F#m]ar?
What do I have to fe[A]ar?

{soc}
If you can hold the st[D]ars in pl[A]ace
You can hold my[E] heart the same

If you can calm the ra[D]ging s[A]ea
You can calm the st[E]orm in me
You're never too f[D]ar aw[A]ay
You never show u[E]p too late
So h[D]ere I am, li[F#m]fting up my he[E]art
To the one who holds the st[A]ars[E]
You're the one who holds the s[A]tars
